There is a lot of innovation going on in JavaScript-land, so much so that the word "churn" has become standard. Some new technologies seem hyper-focused on very web-specific problems, shaving seconds off initial load times or time to interactive. But what exactly is the web up to? Looking at the ecosystem - the open source libraries in popular usage - is definitely not going to paint a complete picture. Nevertheless, there are a lot of people working to solve the problems that they run into most often. And a lot of them are sharing the solutions via open source, even if their largess is commercially motivated. I'd like to see if I can find any parallels to the broader concepts of software engineering, or obvious departures from it.

Let's start by just looking at some popular packages out there and seeing what sort of patterns emerge.

React / Vue / Svelte / Angular: At their heart I think it's fair to say these are view layers. But they aren't just heart - there's a lot of other stuff going on there. In particular, a client-side runtime. That's where the "framework" title comes in. React eschews that title, calling itself a library instead. Why? Because it doesn't directly make decisions about a lot of what makes an app run. But it does nevertheless make some decisions.

JSX and friends: I think it's worth separating this from React and its ilk.

DOM and DOM-impersonation: React has a VDOM, some don't (examples?)

NextJS, Svelte Kit, Remix, Fresh, etc.: Enter the metaframework, aka... the framework. These make a lot more decisions and do a lot more. We also starting entering the "backend". Where React ostensibly just cares about creating a .js file for a browser to run, these tools tend to see what lives on the client as an ephemeral artifact. They therefore need some other runtime (besides the client browser). In usage, you might not even feel the difference - until you go to deploy your website. Next sits on a server and spits out bundles. A straight-up-React app needs to be delivered in a bundle to a browser.

Node, Express, Deno, Bun: runtimes.
